This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to vector reallocation. The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits this error, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when a reference is held to a vector element, and then the vector is modified in a way that invalidates that reference (i.e., via push() operation when it reallocates internally). This can lead to a runtime panic or unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates safe ways to work with vectors to avoid this type of issue.
